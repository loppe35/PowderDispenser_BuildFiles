# 3D Models and CAD Designs

## Overview
This subrepository contains the STL and STEP files for [the Powder Dispensing and Weighing module project repository](https://github.com/loppe35/PowderDispensing_and_Weighing_Module.git). These files represent the 3D models and detailed CAD designs necessary for manufacturing or prototyping the hardware components of the powder dispenser system.

## File Descriptions
- **STL Files**: These files are used for 3D printing. Each file corresponds to a specific part of the powder dispenser, ready for 3D printing on most standard 3D printers.
- **STEP Files**: These files are used for more detailed CAD purposes. They can be imported into various CAD software platforms for further modification or for integrating into larger designs.

## Usage
To use these files, simply import them into your 3D printing software or CAD program of choice. You can use these designs to:
- **Prototype** new modifications or improvements to the hardware.
- **Manufacture** parts directly from the designs using CNC machines or 3D printers.
- **Analyze** the mechanical properties and fit of the components.

## Contributing
If you make any modifications or improvements to the designs, please consider sharing your modified files back with the community under the same licensing terms as this project (CERN OHL-W v2.0). Contributions are welcome and encouraged to foster a collaborative and innovative community.

## License
The 3D models and CAD designs are part of the Powder Dispenser project and are released under the CERN Open Hardware License v2.0 (OHL-W). For more details on the license and your rights to use, modify, and distribute these designs, please refer to the LICENSE document in the root directory of this database.
